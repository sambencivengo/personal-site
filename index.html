			<div class="about">
					<p>I am a fullstack software engineer, cyclist, runner, and birdwatcher 
						interested in building exciting and dynamic applications with other 
						hard-working and like-minded developers. I primarily work with TypeScript, 
						React, and Express.js but I am always pushing myself to learn new technologies.

						An Letterboxd-style application but for books and literature (hence the name: "Lit" - Boxd). A full-stack TypeScript application, I leveraged Express.js for the backend server, PostgeSQL for the database, and MikroORM as an ORM. The frontend was built using Next.js and Chakra UI. This application allows users to create accounts and log into persistent and authenticated sessions. Once logged in, users can add books to a reading list and review books they have read.

						This project was made to be a simple tool to assist my partner's work as a public defender by helping her manage her docket. When she is appointed clients, she may receive between 15-20 individual clients. This happens while court is ongoing so agility is important. Recording each individuals information and scheduling meetings can unnecessarily time consuming so this application was created to assist her needs.

						With the application pulled up on a laptop or phone, each client input their own information, allowing my partner to attend to other important court matters in the background. Clients will saves their names, contact information and the current date into a database for future review. Once the client has submitted their information, they are then prompeted with a Calendly component so they can select an available date and time to schedule a meeting and further discuss their case.

						A simple application for tracking tallies (or counts) in your daily life. Want to create an track how many miles you've ran this week? Bugs squashed in an app you're building? Times you forgot your keys in the car? Simply create a count and increment or decrement it as needed. This application has sign up & log in functionality, persistent sessions and full CRUD. More features to come in the future! This application was built entirely in TypeScript, with an Express.js backend and Next.js frontend. I used ChakraUI for the styling and PostgreSQL for the database.				</p>

							A companion app for Birdwatchers built with a React frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend. Create an account and log the 
							birds you spot out in the field. To spot a bird and add it to your aviary, query a web-scraped database of the ~1200 bird species
							that live in the United states and log its GPS location with the Google Maps API. Aviaries are visible to other users, and can be viewed 
							along with recent spottings in the feed section.
